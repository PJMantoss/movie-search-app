Movie-Search-App uses the TMDb API to retrieve information about movies. It's built with React and styled with CSS using the BEM syntax.

TECH OVERVIEW:

- Functional Components
- React Hooks
- CSS grid
- TMDB API

PURPOSE: The project was done to practice the use of functional components, React Hooks and Fetch together with Async/Await feature of JavaScript.

I started building the app by creating the component folders and signing up on the Movies DB to get an API key. Then I added base styles to the app. Next, I created the SearchMovies asyn functional component containing the API call using Fetch. Then I added 2 states - one for input query and the second for movies.
